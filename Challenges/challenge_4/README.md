# Challenge 4
* Worked with Sukhrob: https://github.com/Sukhrobjon/CS-2.2-Challenges/tree/master/Challenges
In your README - Clearly define the problem. Give full credit to any references you use.
In your README - Define in words, the 5 steps of DP as applied to this problem.
## Part 1: Solve the Knapsack Problem using Dynamic Programming.

### Resources:

## 5 Step of DP that was used:

## 5 Steps of Dynamic Programming for Edit Distance
* Should we insert, remove, or replace current character to get closer to equating the two strings

* We can start traversing the two strings from either left or right.

* We are taking the minimum number edits between inserting, removing, or replacing, current character

* Compute distance with memoization utilizing tabular reference table containing both string's values

* Return the minimum between the three edit choices (insert, remove, or replace)


## Part 2: Solve any other DP problem not discussed in class.
