# Challenge 4

In your README - Clearly define the problem. Give full credit to any references you use.
In your README - Define in words, the 5 steps of DP as applied to this problem.
## Part 1: Solve the Knapsack Problem using Dynamic Programming.

### Resources:
* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-knapsack-problem-dp-10/

## 5 Step of DP that was used:

## 5 Steps of Dynamic Programming
* Identify the sub-problems
* Guess first choice
* Recursively define the value of an optimal solution
* Compute the value of an optimal solution (recurse and memoize)
* Solve original problem - reconstruct from the sub-problems


## Part 2: Solve any other DP problem not discussed in class.
